When the Properties and the methods of the parent class are accessed by the child class, we call the concept has inheritance.
The Child class can inherit the parent method and give own method implementation, this property is called overridden method.
When the same method of the parent class is inherited we call as inherited method. Now let us see types of inheritance supported in
Object Oriented Programming and Corresponding PHP Inheritance examples.

Types of Inheritance:

Single level Inheritance : In Single level Inheritance the Parent Class Methods will be extended by the child class. All the methods
can be inherited.

MultiLevel Inheritance : In MultiLevel Inheritance, the parent class method will be inherited by the child class and again subclass
will inherit the child class method.
